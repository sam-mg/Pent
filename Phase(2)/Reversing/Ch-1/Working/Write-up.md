Using the file option in terminal.
I found out, it is a kind of executable file.

To execute it, use ./<filename>

It is asking to eneter a second input as the flag.
Use IDA Freeware to view what is there in the code.

Got just an hint.
Used that C code and Converted it into Python.
Using that code, Wrote another code with the given data and trial and error method, to get the flag.

Got it.

- flag{_y0u_f0und_key_}
